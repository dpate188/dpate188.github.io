Set to achieve CPA eligibility by 2027, Dhruv combines his academic journey with real-world experience, demonstrating a strong foundation in leadership, strategic thinking, and community service. As an active member of UC Riversideâ€™s Business Strategy Club and HES Initiative Intern since April 2024, Dhruv has sharpened his critical thinking and decision-making skills through case studies and corporate strategy simulations. Collaborating with peers on competitive presentations and team projects, he has gained valuable insight into real-world business challenges and executive-level problem-solving.<br><br>

His responsibilities include managing logistics, budgeting, and fundraising efforts, showcasing his project management and leadership abilities. His passion for promoting cultural heritage drives him to create engaging and meaningful experiences that celebrate South Asian diversity. Dhruv is deeply involved in his community through his long-standing leadership roles at BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Chino Hills.

His contributions to organizing annual youth conventions and charity events across the West Coast have further solidified his commitment to service and cultural preservation.<br><br>

        In 2023, Dhruv expanded his impact through his work with BAPS Akshardham North America in Robbinsville, NJ, where he played a key role in a 10-week blood drive initiative, collecting over 6,000 pints of blood to save more than 18,000 lives. Additionally, he helped coordinate a large-scale cultural program that welcomed over 5,000 attendees, blending spirituality and community outreach through multimedia experiences and guest speaker engagements. Dhruvâ€™s technical proficiency includes experience with Google Workspace, Microsoft Office Suite, Canva, and CapCut.
